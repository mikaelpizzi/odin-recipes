Odin recipes

This project is a simple website about the HTML fundamentals made during the foundations course on The Odin Project about my favorites recipes: Spaghetti carbonara, torikatsu chicken and lemon pie.

With this project I have practiced the HTML boilerplate and the essential tags to implement a static but functional website (like title, a, ul, ol, li and others), the webpages are connected via anchors and there is another anchor for going back to the top of the page. I also used Git and Github and learned how to write better commits (with mistakes in the way), all this is the base for something bigger.
